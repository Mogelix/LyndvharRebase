<b>Lyndhardtia burns. An age of prosperity destroyed. What will the future hold for the world?</b>
<br>
<br>
Casted into existence by the fiery hammer of Malum at the behest of the Sun Mother Astrata, the realm of Beowricke has always stood on the precipice of danger - culminating in the fiery and destructive battles of the BLOODWAKE- a battle between the ARCHDAEMONS and the PANTHEON. After the battle had been won by the PANTHEON, they retreated to their own domains to lick their wounds and recover. The long and enduring period between this time was known as the GILDED AGE, which lasted for thousands of years. The years after the end of the GILDED AGE saw a rapid decline in technology, and many different devices and their uses being lost to time- most notably many Dwarven artifacts. Nestled in a small region of Llewyn- decades after the end of this period- is where one of the largest empires the realms had ever seen would be born, through one elf's domination.

<br>
Aevislan was a formidable city state, ruled by the dynasty of LYNDHARDTIA. Having been consistently harassed and sacked by the established orcish tribes of the west, for a long time it was nothing more than a tributary. However, with the ascension of NAEXIDOR LYNDHARDTIA, this would forever be changed. His strength and cunning prowess on the battlefield led to successful destruction of the orc tribes, casting them into almost complete obscurity, relegated to minor tribes in the far western plains and mountains. But the conquest did not stop there, as Naexidor set his sights upon the north, the east, and parts of the west, slowly but surely conquering city after city, and nation after nation. This almost divine conquest led many in the Pantheonic Church to believe him blessed by the Ten themselves. Through his conquests the Kingdom of Lyndhardtia was formed, named after the founding dynasty, and consecrated by Naexidor. His descendants would hold onto this Kingdom for generations, bringing about almost complete dominion over Llewyn. But all empires fall eventually.
<br>
<br>
Nearly two-hundred years have passed since Naexidor’s original conquest, and his dynasty has sat on the Ruby Throne of Aevislan since. However, the Queen, CAMILLA LYNDHARDTIA never had children. With her death at the age of 74 and no direct heir of the Lyndhardtia line, claimants began to emerge. 
<br>
<br>
BALERON, bastard son of the previous king before CAMILLA, SOLOMON, declared themself the true ruler of Lyndhardtia, and began to amass their forces to establish their foothold.
<br>
<br>
To counter this claim, VLADISLAV, a claimant backed by many in the Mother Church, also laid claim- despite having no true blood relation. He claims that Astrata herself came to him in his dreams, declaring him the true successor of Naexidor themself.
<br>
<br>
The Duke of Dunargi, GUNTHARD, also joined the pool of claimants. His claims are more popular with the common folk, as not only does he control much of the Heartlands, he had been a benevolent champion of the peasantry.
<br>
<br>
LAURENCE, previously the Grand Archmagus of the Arcane Eyrie, set his eyes upon carving his own section of the realm for himself. Despite having only minor support from sorcerers, the strength of his magic sees almost no equal. Through this he carved out his own slice of the realm.
<br>
<br>
And with this, the Kingdom of Lyndhardtia would enter an age of civil war and destruction that the world had not seen since the BLOODWAKE- the RUBY WAR. Such destruction on such a scale would bring the entirety of the RUBY THRONE to its knees- culminating in a total collapse of all authority beyond the capital regions of the claimants.
<br>
<br>
Lyndhardtia is dying; scent of shit and pus and maggot-filth in the air. With a resurgence of chaos, cultists of the daemonic deities have begun to re-amass themselves. Orders from darkness begin to resurface, once thought extinct. Whispered murmurs speak of the ARCHDAEMONS, a return to daes of destruction not seen since the Bloodwake.
<br>
<br>
Along the eastern coastline of the empire, the port city of LYNDVHAR still stands firm as one of the very few bastions not razed to the ground by the war. The court of LYNDVHAR has not heard word from the capital in years, nor seen any signs of claimant forces in the area- and thus has had to rule by itself for the last two decades as a city-state. Autocratic rule of decree by the Viscount has become a de-facto way of life. The Church purges anyone who seems even remotely unfaithful in order to keep the city safe. And yet still- word of darkness coming from the abyss spreads. The dead rise, goblins and orcs make camp, and boats have been seen off the coast. Banditry has made travel almost impossible, and worse has begun to brew potentially in the deepwoods - the howls of volves, and reports of blood-drained carcasses..

<b>Children of the Pantheon, the Kingdom of Lyndhardtia is tearing itself apart, destruction runs rampant, and evil resurfaces-</b> will you lose your faith in the Ten that have guided and nurtured you?
<br>
<b>Ambitious cultists, worshippers of the daemonic, and even darker-</b> will you rise up and remake this land in your image, bringing subjugation and compliance in the name of your Daemonic masters?
<br>
<b>Those of the Valorian Orthodoxy-</b> will you yet persist as stoically and wilfully as HE does?
<br>
<b>Lowly fool- will you survive the oncoming storm?</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Beowricke awaits your mask, actor.</b>
